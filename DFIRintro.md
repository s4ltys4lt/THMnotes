##  Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ What is DFIR?
DFIR stands for **Digital Forensics and Incident Response**. It's the practice of identifying, investigating, and mitigating cybersecurity incidents.

### ðŸ”¹ The DFIR Process
1. **Preparation** â€“ Establish policies, procedures, and a response team.
2. **Identification** â€“ Detect and analyze indicators of compromise.
3. **Containment** â€“ Limit the scope and impact of the attack.
4. **Eradication** â€“ Remove threats and fix vulnerabilities.
5. **Recovery** â€“ Restore systems and monitor for further activity.
6. **Lessons Learned** â€“ Review the incident and improve procedures.

### ðŸ”¹ Order of Volatility
| Order | Data Type                       | Description                          |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1     | CPU registers, cache            | Most volatile, lost instantly        |
| 2     | RAM                              | Can be extracted with volatility     |
| 3     | Network connections              | Includes ARP tables, routing tables  |
| 4     | Disk                             | Persistent storage                   |
| 5     | Backups, archival media         | Least volatile                       |

### ðŸ”¹ Evidence Collection & Imaging
- Use tools like `FTK Imager`, `dd`, or `Autopsy` to create forensically sound disk images.
- Always maintain **chain of custody**.

### ðŸ”¹ Hashing
- Used to verify integrity of evidence.
- Common hashes: `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-256`.

##  Tools Introduced

| Tool         | Use Case                                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| FTK Imager   | Disk imaging and preview                 |
| Autopsy      | GUI-based forensic analysis              |
| Volatility   | Memory forensics                         |
| Strings      | Extract readable ASCII/Unicode text      |
| HashCalc     | Generate hashes for file integrity       |

##  Key Takeaways

- The DFIR process is as much about **procedure** as it is about tools.
- Evidence must be handled carefully to remain legally admissible.
- Practicing memory and disk forensics is essential for real-world SOC and blue team roles.

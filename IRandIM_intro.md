##  What I Learned

### üîπ What is Incident Response?
A structured approach for managing and responding to cybersecurity incidents.

**Goals of IR:**
- Minimize damage
- Reduce recovery time and costs
- Learn from the incident

### üîπ Incident Response Lifecycle (NIST)

| Phase            | Description                                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Preparation   | Establish policies, train staff, and gather tools.                       |
| 2. Identification| Detect and confirm an incident is happening.                             |
| 3. Containment   | Limit the spread and impact of the incident.                             |
| 4. Eradication   | Remove the root cause and affected elements.                             |
| 5. Recovery      | Restore normal operations securely.                                       |
| 6. Lessons Learned| Post-mortem analysis, documentation, and improvement.                  |

### üîπ Incident Management Roles

| Role                  | Responsibility                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Incident Responder     | Investigates and handles technical aspects         |
| Incident Manager       | Coordinates the response process                   |
| Communications Lead    | Handles internal and external communication        |
| Legal & Compliance     | Ensures regulatory obligations are met             |
| Executive Leadership   | Makes high-level decisions                         |

### üîπ Key Concepts

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Evidence that a system has been breached.
- **Playbooks**: Predefined procedures for specific incident types.
- **Severity Levels**: Incidents are ranked based on scope and impact.
- **Chain of Custody**: Tracks evidence handling for legal validity.

##  Tools Mentioned

| Tool         | Use Case                            |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| SIEM         | Aggregates and analyzes logs         |
| Ticketing    | Tracks incident progress             |
| Forensics Tools | Evidence collection & analysis   |

##  My Key Takeaways

- IR isn't just technical‚Äî**communication and coordination are equally important.**
- Having a **clear, repeatable process** reduces panic and increases response effectiveness.
- **Documentation and post-incident review** are often overlooked but essential for improvement.

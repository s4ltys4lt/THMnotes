## Room Summary

The **Common Attacks** room provides an overview of some of the most common and dangerous attack techniques used in cybersecurity. The room walks through multiple attack methods such as **SQL Injection (SQLi)**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Command Injection**, **Buffer Overflow**, and **Denial of Service (DoS)**. It provides hands-on practice with each attack type to give users a better understanding of how they work and how to defend against them.
